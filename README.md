Hi! I’m Shreya/Shre – just a curious human messing around with Python, ML, and web dev 🐍🌐  
Currently exploring how to make cool things and occasionally break them (on purpose... maybe).

### 🧪 Stuff I Know

- Python (a lot of it)
- Web dev basics (HTML, CSS, JS)
- A sprinkle of ML magic
- GitHub (still forgets `git pull` sometimes)
